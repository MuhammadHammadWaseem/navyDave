                    <h2>Navy <span>Dave's</span> Story</h2>
                    <p>For 20 years, I proudly served the US Navy. I boarded non compliant illegal Iraqi oil smugglers from 1996-2001 and did 2 tours boots on the ground in Iraq out of Al Asad. I ended up completing 10 total deployments.</p>
                    <p>In my time, I suffered injuries. Some seen, others not seen. I retired in 2014 and tried to go to work. I was a first assistant manager in the Safeway non commissioned officer to first assistant manager program. When Albertsons bought out Safeway, the program went away. I found a job as a manager for Starbucks. I started losing my mental acuity with writing schedules. My next issue started when I could tell you how to make the drink, but couldn’t physically do it. The final “act” was when I thought I was having a heart attack. In the ER, I was told I had an anxiety attack, something I’d never even heard of. Soon after I was diagnosed with PTSD. </p>
                    <p>Since 2017, I’ve been struggling with depression, anxiety, self worth and not being able to work. In going through counseling, I was asked what I liked to do outside. I said golf. He said “then you should golf!” A doctor actually prescribed me golf! Since I couldn’t seem to hold down a “normal” 9-5, I volunteered as a state director and assistant Regional Director for the Veteran Golfers Association. Those positions gave me purpose and allowed me to help others. </p>
                    <p>In that same way, a few things that I’m proud of are leading others by example and finding ways to help others. Every individual is unique and gifted in a very specific way. We don’t all learn the same. I earned my Master Training Specialist certification by finding ways to reach everyone. During my down time in Iraq, I helped teach an ASVAB prep course to Soldiers and Marines to raise their scores high enough to apply for warrant officer programs. The students named me their favorite and most valued instructor. I truly enjoyed being a part of their success!</p>
                    <p>I’d been acting as a volunteer marshal at a golf course one day a week for the past year. In that time, I’ve helped people with their golf swings. Not with an entirely new swing or a “PGA tour” swing but with adjusting their own swing to help it work better for them.  I’ve worked with old and young, men and women, good and “weekend warrior”. I’ve helped them all get better!</p>
                    <p>I’ve also caddied for a few professional golfers on the mini tours in Arizona and Utah. I was proud to be a part of 5 top 10 finishes including 2 seconds!</p>
